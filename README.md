# Early-Detection-of-Diabetes-from-Its-symptoms-using-Machine-Learning-
EDA of Diabetes and Early detection of diabetes from its symptoms Using Machine Learning
Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information related to diabetes symptoms and to develop machine learning models for the early detection of diabetes. The ultimate aim is to identify a suitable model that can potentially be deployed in an Android application for general users.

Project Role
This project is undertaken by a final-year bachelor's student to demonstrate skills in data analysis, machine learning model development, and evaluation.

Dataset
The project uses the diabetes.csv dataset, which contains various features related to diabetes symptoms and a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Step-by-Step Process
The project follows a structured approach, divided into the following steps:

Project Setup and Data Loading:

Setting up the Python environment and importing necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Loading the diabetes.csv dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performing descriptive statistics to understand the data's central tendencies, spread, and distribution.
Checking for missing values and identifying potential data inconsistencies.
Analyzing the distribution of the target variable ('class').
Visualizing feature distributions and relationships between features and the target variable (histograms, box plots, correlation matrices - Note: Some of these visualizations were planned but not explicitly generated in the provided notebook. You may want to add code for these in the notebook to enrich the EDA section.).
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

Handling missing values (though none were found in this dataset).
Encoding categorical features (e.g., using Label Encoding as shown in the notebook for features like 'Polyuria', 'Polydipsia', etc.).
Splitting the data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.
Model Selection and Training:

Selecting appropriate binary classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Training these models on the preprocessed training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
Analyzing confusion matrices to understand the models' performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Tuning the hyperparameters of the selected models to optimize their performance using techniques like GridSearchCV (demonstrated for Random Forest).
Final Model Selection and Interpretation:

Selecting the best-performing model based on the evaluation metrics and the project's goals, considering the trade-offs between different metrics for a medical application.
Interpreting the chosen model to understand the importance of different features in predicting diabetes.
Model Export and Preparation for Deployment:

Saving the final trained and tuned model (e.g., using joblib or pickle) for potential deployment.
Documenting the model's input requirements and necessary preprocessing steps for making predictions on new data.
Documentation and Presentation:

Organizing the project findings and code in a clear and structured manner (as seen in the notebook).
Summarizing the EDA insights, model performance, and conclusions.
Considerations for Android Application:
